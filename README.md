# Aestuarium

Yet another wayland background manager using openGL. This is still in very early stages of development and I don't recommend anyone to use it yet.

### Why another tool for background in wayland?

Because all other tools for background didn't have the features I want and also nothing bad in some competition

### Why the name "Aestuarium" 

It is the latin for [Estuary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estuary), I will leave the explanation to your imagination.
